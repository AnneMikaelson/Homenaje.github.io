        <p id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Satoru's life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1965: Satoru Gojo is born, the first heir of the six eyes and the unlimited curse technique in more than 400 years. His existence alters the balance of power between humanity and curses. </li>
            <li>1989: Satoru Gojo graduates from the Metropolitan Magic Technical College of Tokyo and becomes a special class shaman.</li>
            <li>2006: Satoru Gojo faces Toji Fushiguro, a shaman killer hired by the Zenin clan. During the battle, Gojo shows his maximum power by uncovering his eyes and using his special technique known as Rikugan.</li>
            <li>2017: Satoru Gojo becomes the teacher of the Metropolitan Magic Technical College of Tokyo and takes care of the first-year students.</li>
            <li>2018: Satoru Gojo is sealed in the prison realm by Pseudo-Geto, an impostor who uses the body of Suguru Geto and works for the terrorist group Q. The seal prevents Gojo from using his powers or communicating with the outside. His absence causes a crisis in the world of shamans and curses, who take advantage of it to attack humanity.</li>
            <li>2022: Satoru Gojo is freed from the seal by Yuta Okkotsu. Gojo then reunites with his students and friends, and prepares to face the curses and their allies</li>
            <li>2023: Satoru Gojo dies at the hands of Ryomen Sukuna.</li>
            
        </ul>
